# Herd Immunity Simulation

This little simulation is intended to visualize herd immunity to disease, at least as a concept. The reality of disease transmission is way more complicated.

Change these parameters on the population to watch how the infection propagates:

- **Percentage of population that is immune.** This includes people who were successfully vaccinated or who acquired immunity some other way. The remainder represents the unsuccessfully vaccinated, the immuno-compromised, the ideologically anti-vaccine, etc. *0% or 100% would be nigh impossible in reality.*
- **Probability of transmission on contact.** Different diseases are transmitted in different ways. On the high-end of communicability we have airborn transmission and on the low-end we have sexual transmission. We'll represent this in a simpler way: two individuals who come into contact will or will not transmit the disease based on this probability. *0% or 100% would be nigh impossible in reality.*
